# linear_algebra_containers
Some basic, c++ template linear algebra classes (vector, matrix, quaternion)
useful for computer graphics or other computations.

This Readme will be updated shortly. There is still much work to do on the
classes even though most basic operations are working. If you want to help or
if you found any bugs feel free to contact me.

Main areas of work:
 - more quaternion methods
 - more tests
 - Matrix4x4 and Matrix3x3 classes with convenience methods
 - more graphics related features like rotations etc.
